# NBBttest
## Introduction
NBBttest is R package for implementing negative binomial beta t-test (or called NBBt-test). NBBt-test is a statistical method for differential analysis of multiple types of RNA-seq data. NBBt-test is based on negative binomial distribution with parameters p and r where r is number of RNA sequences failed to be sequenced in RNA population (or RNA library) and p is proportion of the sequenced RNA species in RNA library and follows beta distibution with parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$.
